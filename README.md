In this analysis, we used the Sample - Superstore.csv dataset, which contains detailed records of sales transactions including order dates, sales values, and order IDs. The exercise demonstrated several key data analysis skills essential for a data analyst role. We started by applying date formatting and extraction to convert raw date strings into structured Year-Month formats suitable for time-based grouping. Then, using both SQL and Python, we applied aggregation functions such as SUM() and COUNT(DISTINCT) to compute monthly revenue and order volumes. This was followed by implementing temporal data visualization logic through sorted, period-wise aggregations to highlight trends. We also introduced filtering techniques to narrow down data to a specific year (2016), providing focused insights. Finally, the results were exported into Excel and SQL formats, making them suitable for presentation, sharing, or further reporting. This end-to-end process mirrors a real-world business analytics task and equips you with the hands-on experience needed in a data-driven role.
